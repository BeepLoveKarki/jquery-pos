{"name":"jQuery POS","tagline":"Bringing point of sale to the cloud","body":"jquery-pos v0.0.1 _Beta_\r\n========================\r\n\r\nPoint of sale hardware support plugin for jQuery\r\n\r\nI have currently only tested this plugin on 1 type of barcode scanner and credit card magnetc stripe reader. However, so far tests have been very successful and promising.\r\nAny code contributions are much appreciated as I'm sure we can develop more extensive Regexp options that span accross different barcode types and other forms of CC Data.\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\n\r\nSimply include _jquery.pos.js_ on your site then use the following code block:\r\n```javascript\r\n$(function(){\r\n\t$(document).pos();\r\n\t$(document).on('scan.pos.barcode', function(event){\r\n\t\t//access `event.code` - barcode data\r\n\t});\r\n\t$(document).on(swipe.pos.card', function(event){\r\n\t\t//access following:\r\n\t\t// `event.card_number` - card number only\r\n\t\t// `event.card_holder_first_name` - card holder first name only\r\n\t\t// `event.card_holder_last_name` - card holder last name only\r\n\t\t// `event.card_exp_date_month` - card expiration month - 2 digits\r\n\t\t// `event.card_exp_date_year_2` - card expiration year - 2 digits\r\n\t\t// `event.card_exp_date_year_4` - card expiration year - 4 digits\r\n\t\t// `event.swipe_data` - original swipe data from raw processing or sending to a 3rd party service\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also override the following default options...\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar options = {\r\n    scan: true, //enable scan event\r\n    swipe: true, //enable swipe event\r\n    events: {\r\n\tscan: {\r\n\t    barcode: 'scan.pos.barcode' //event name for successfully scanned barcode\r\n\t},\r\n\tswipe: {\r\n\t    card: 'swipe.pos.card' //event name for successfully scanned card\r\n\t}\r\n    },\r\n    regexp: {\r\n\tscan: {\r\n\t    barcode: '\\\\d+' //regexp for barcode validation\r\n\t},\r\n\tswipe: {\r\n\t    card: '\\\\%B(\\\\d+)\\\\^(\\\\w+)\\\\/(\\\\w+)\\\\^\\\\d+\\\\?;\\\\d+=(\\\\d\\\\d)(\\\\d\\\\d)\\\\d+\\\\?' //regexp for credit card validation\r\n\t}\r\n    },\r\n    prefix: {\r\n\tscan: {\r\n\t    barcode: '' //prefix for barcode - will be added to regexp\r\n\t},\r\n\tswipe: {\r\n\t    card: '' //prefix for credit card - will be added to regexp\r\n\t}\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\n$(document).pos(options);\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
